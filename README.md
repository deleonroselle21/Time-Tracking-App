## My process


Here is the solution that ive made to develop this challenge. 
 
The challenge was  to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly. This was addressed by creating a usestate  that will hold the value of the selected timeframe and then passing this value to the cardcomponent that will create the card for each object . 

Using event.target.name i was able to get the name of the selected element and used this to update the time variable and switch between daily, weekly, and monthly. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
