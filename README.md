### What I learned

In doing this challenge, I learned how to create and a mobile responsive website using flex and grid with React framework

Here is the solution that ive made to develop this challenge. 
 
The challenge was  to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly. This was addressed by creating a usestate  that will hold the value of the selected timeframe and then passing this value to the cardcomponent that will create the card for each object . 

Using event.target.name i was able to get the name of the selected element and used this to update the time variable and switch between daily, weekly, and monthly. 

Data was retrieved from a local json file  using a  map function. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
